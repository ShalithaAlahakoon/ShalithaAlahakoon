## Few Projects that I have worked on

### Assignment Management System
**Tech Stack:** MongoDB, Express, React, Node  
Utilizing the MVC architecture, we built this online web application using the MERN stack. Instructors can update their marks using the system designed to manage students‚Äô assignments.

### Globaledulink B2B LMS
**Tech Stack:** Laravel, Vue JS, Vapor, AWS  
Incorporating the Inertia framework, we prioritize Domain-Driven Architecture (DDA) principles as key considerations. Developed as a B2B platform, this platform enables other online course sellers to publish Globaledulink courses on their websites. I contributed to this system by developing modules for client registration, user management, and certificate handling.

### [Globaledulink Learning Management System](https://production-gel.imperiallearning.org/)
**Tech Stack:** Laravel, Vue JS, Vapor, AWS  
Utilizing DDA principles and the Inertia framework, this project is designed to optimize the UK‚Äôs educational landscape. I spearheaded the establishment of the exam module, assignment module, learner dashboard, checkout process for student IDs, exams, assignments, registrations, and resolved various bug fixes, collectively accounting for 30% to 35% of the system.

### Student Management System
**Tech Stack:**  
Improved using the MERN stack, GlobalEdulink has created a web-based system. The aim of this system is to facilitate marketing and sales activities while also maintaining records of all students across the company‚Äôs five websites, serving as a centralized system. I have been involved in the Email templates module, master settings, main dashboard, and managing the database within this system.

### [E-commerce Web App for Royalro Cake Shop](https://github.com/ShalithaAlahakoon/ROYALRO-Cake-Shop)
**Tech Stack:** JAVA, JSP  
Constructed for the party management company, the platform includes management systems for cakes, decorations, and product details. Customers can conveniently view available items along with their details in the online store. I contributed to the system by implementing Product CRUD operations, user authentication and registration functionalities, and developing the cart checkout process.
